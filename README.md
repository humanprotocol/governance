![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Governance_UI-purple?style=flat)

The Governance UI serves as a central interface for interacting with the Human Protocol's governance system, incorporating elements from both our client and server components to provide a comprehensive tool for community-driven decision-making.

## About This Project

This project leverages a modified Uniswap Interface to facilitate a transparent and user-friendly governance system. It enables users to actively participate in the governance process of the Human Protocol by navigating and exploring proposals across the primary hub chain and associated spoke chains.

## Features

Holistic Governance View: Access and interact with governance proposals, including detailed information and voting capabilities across hub and spoke chains.
Token Exchange: Seamlessly exchange tokens to participate in governance, supporting hmt and vhmt tokens.
Vote Aggregation: Backend services aggregate votes from various chains, ensuring accurate and up-to-date voting results.
Decentralized and Secure: Built on the Ethereum blockchain for secure and efficient transactions.
