# **Proposal: HMT Token Locking Mechanism for Enhanced Worker Compensation**

## **Abstract**

This proposal introduces a **token-locking mechanism** for workers in the HUMAN Protocol ecosystem. By **locking HMT tokens**, workers receive **bonus payments** proportional to the amount and duration locked. This aligns worker **commitment** with network **stability** and long-term engagement.

## **Motivation**

The current HUMAN Protocol payment system rewards workers based on task completion without considering their long-term commitment to the network. By introducing a **token-locking mechanism**, workers can demonstrate reliability and receive additional incentives. This approach will encourage **worker retention and loyalty**.

## **Specification**

### **1\. Locking Mechanism**

Workers can voluntarily lock **a portion of their HMT tokens** within the HUMAN Protocol staking smart contract.

### **2\. Bonus Payment**

Workers who lock tokens receive an **extra percentage of their earnings in HMT,** based on the locked amount and duration.
